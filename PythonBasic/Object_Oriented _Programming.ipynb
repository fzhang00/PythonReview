    "\n",
    "Object oriented programming is a design paradigm (model) to structure code and data. \n",
    "\n",
    "Object is constructed by calling ```Class```. Object has its own attributes (data) and methods (function). Calss is the tempate for creating object. Like using a cookie cutter (class) to make cookies (objects). \n",
    "\n",
    "* A class is defined by using keyword ```class```\n",
    "* Class name convention: \n",
    "    * Use Camel case\n",
    "    * Do not use underscore\n",
    "    * Example: Cookie, MyCookie\n",
    "* ```__init__()``` method is used to create a new object. This method is called whenever a new object is instantiated. \n",
    "    * ```__init__()``` can accept input arguments.\n",
    "    * All attribute should be declare in the ```__init__()``` method. \n",
    "    * If the initial value is unkonwn, use ```None```\n",
    "* All class method must have the first input argument: self\n",
    "\n",
    "Example:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "class MyClass:\n",
    "    def __init__(self, input1, input2):\n",
    "        self.a = input1\n",

    "Python allows user to directly read and write object attributes by ```object_name.attribute_name```. However, in some causes for the purpose of protecting attributes and have flexibility in future update of the class, we can also write methods to read and write attributes. \n",
